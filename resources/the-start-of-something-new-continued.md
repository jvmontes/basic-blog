3. At-home exercises
4. Strategy & plan for RE biz.
5. Strategy & plan for personal projects & career goals.

Real estate is basically where people live. It's a business industry that is very local and personal. 

I want to be a product owner. I want to help build my own project, my own business.

A fair note to anyone who chooses to read this after it's been written: 

I am very proud of myself. 

The choices I have made have granted me a very beautiful, comfortable lifestyle. I want to continue to seek ways to make my lifestyle work, and create the change I wish to see.

There was something about writing this page on paper by the light of a candle that made us feel so significant, so rustic, so decisive and life-changing.

I know going into this year, I plan to be "up to" big things financially, with my words, with the way I behave, with my physical habits, with the way I feel about myself. And finally, with the way in which I share myself and communicate with others. The way I show up for people. 

May God continue to grace me with air in my lungs to the presence of his holy, divine nature. 

Amen.

**A Quiet, Candle-lit Evening**

********************************Sunday, January 1st, 2023. 10 PM********************************

There he sat on his throne, illuminated by two candles placed on top of a small side table that was placed in front of the large rear windows of the house on the 2nd floor. It overlooked the alley, the neighboring houses, some warehouse across the street, and a far-off view of Chicago Downtown, five or so miles away. 

He built his itineraries, working away at his work. His chair was a Too $hort simple office chair he found somewhere in this old house. Meticulously and intricately conjuring up his stories, systems, organizations and processes.

The life he was trying to build for himself took time, purpose, insistence, and unwavering commitment to write it out and get it all done.

His work was just about completed for the night. He reviewed the pages and felt a confidence for what his day would look like the next day. He blew out the candles, stretched and prepared his outfit for his run tomorrow, listened to classical music on his small alarm clock radio, and went to sleep.

******************************************Systems and Processes******************************************

January 3rd, 2023. 10 AM. 

Ok, so, I‚Äôm writing a blog about writing a blog and making the process for said blog. 

This is the depth that they talk about. 

I am using this physical notebook to flow freely. 

In my black Blue Sky planning calendar for January 2023 ‚Äì December 2023, all the way back in the Notes section, I wrote an entire section on the apartment posting process for my work yesterday. Now, I'm writing in the next section, and I am doing a custom content upload process.

I'm really happy with this setup I have going. I feel like every layer is put appropriately in place. I have this notebook page for storytelling, a weekly planner for planning out my day is in my week, and a separate section at the back of the planner to use as notes. This is awesome!

<aside>
üé∏ **Also, quick side note.** 

Cinema ‚Äî Skrillex Remix by Benny Benassi, Gary Go, & Skrillex
is an absolute jam. I want to dance to it, stretch, & do a video of it. 
It‚Äôs fun, & feels good. 

We should share more content to feed our body and soul.

</aside>

Welp, that's everything in my notebook for now. Thanks for reading and thanks for hanging out and thanks for being human with me for a moment together. 

Go out there, chase your dreams, 

and make the world a better place for you and me.

Peace ‚úåüèº
