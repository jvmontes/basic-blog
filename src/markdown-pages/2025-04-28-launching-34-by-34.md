# Launching 34-by-34: A New Chapter

Today marks the beginning of a project I've been dreaming about for a long time ‚Äî and it starts with a simple idea: **show up every day, share something real, and build a bridge to my next chapter.**

**34-by-34** is a campaign I'm launching to celebrate my upcoming 34th birthday:  
**34 reflections, lessons, explorations, and creative projects**, all shared through this blog.

This project is about:

- üî• Consistency over perfection
- üß† Reflection over speed
- üé∏ Creativity across disciplines: tech, music, leadership, mindset, nutrition, and more

I'll be sharing a mix of **written stories, audio recordings, videos**, and **project breakdowns** ‚Äî all aiming to capture the energy, lessons, and momentum of this moment in my journey.

**I'm using AI, automation, and my personal creative toolkit to superpower the process.**  
_(Big fan of working smarter, not just harder.)_

## Why 34-by-34?

Because I believe the best way to honor where we‚Äôre going is to **honor where we‚Äôve been**.  
Because this next chapter deserves intention.  
Because the world moves fast ‚Äî but our stories deserve to breathe.
