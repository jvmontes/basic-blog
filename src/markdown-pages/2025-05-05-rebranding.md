## Monday, May 5th, 2025, 1:56PM.

Hello, world! It is I, Jorge Viramontes, coming back at ya with a brand new blog entry! Today we are on blog entry #4 of our road to 34 blogs by May 30th, 2025! What sort of mess did I get myself into-- stay tuned to find out!

<aside class="callout">
  <div>üí°</div> <div><strong>Note:</strong> For this post, I will work to maintain the blog strictly in my own voice, not with the assistance of an AI assistant ü§ñ. All of the text content, aka the storytelling, is originally written (you can probably tell). AI is only used to achieve styling tasks, resolve issues, and help with the creative process-- not for its generative content creation capabilities. </div>

</aside>

I am at [Cafe El Meson](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4yY5Khd1RXfCRYwu8) sipping on a latte and listening to my [üéª Classical Music playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1QP9ZaHzM0VxSRiURJMXMW?si=f7102b4c301f4d2e) on shuffle with noise-cancelling headphones.

## Restoring Integrity

### I currently am an unemployed-solopreneur-multi-hyphenate.

I could go into detail and tell you my story right here and now, but I think the most important part for you to know is that:

### I am a software engineer and builder, and I‚Äôm currently working on dedicating concentrated time on building my personal website, using it as a platform to work on my craft, shape my narrative, and channel my voice.

I‚Äôm a pretty fast typer. Through typing, my fingers can mostly keep up with my brain, better than the pen can. So here we are, re-launching this thing, yet again.

But this time, it‚Äôs different. I see the larger strategy. I have my priorities in order. I‚Äôm in a good headspace to just _produce_, and I‚Äôm so grateful for that.

---

## 5/5/2025 2:02PM.

Anywho, I have an ongoing list of things I‚Äôd like to do. I‚Äôm going to try and dedicate time to get this done as quickly as possible, leveraging a bit of AI if I need it.

My objective is to re-do my blog‚Äôs branding‚Äî logo, colors, fonts, etc. I have a pretty good idea of how to do this, but now just need to execute.

This is particularly fun for me, because this will be the first time I fully document my workflow, make the changes, and post the artifact somewhere.

## Current State of the Blog

Before implementing these changes, it‚Äôs always nice to see where we‚Äôre at to acknowledge how far we‚Äôve come in our work.

Here are some screenshots of different components of this fun project.

### Current Website Homepage

### Blog Entry Social Media Link

Below, you can see what a link to my blog looks like on LinkedIn. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt include any images or additional description text. It would be nice to add these things to make the preview more visually engaging. I‚Äôm going to look into this!

![Social Media Post on LinkedIn](/images/blog-4/34-by-34-linkedin-post.png)

### Blog Entry iMessage Preview

Below, this is what it looks like on iMessage. I would like to enrich this, as well.

### Blog Entry on Web

This is what an entry on the blog currently looks like.

## Future Vision of the Blog

As time has gone on, it‚Äôs been hightime for me to refresh my blog.

### The new aesthetic will be professional, bold, impactful, and trustworthy.

<aside class="callout">

  <div>üìî</div> <div><strong>Note: </strong>Btw, I wrote this entire post on a Notion page first. It‚Äôs fun bc I‚Äôm used to using Notion, and it‚Äôs a great way for me to write fast, get all the pieces together I want, and then at transfer time, it should be pretty straightforward (except images, which will require some manual effort) to transfer onto a `.md` file for hosting on my domain. Fun stuff!

</aside>

Let‚Äôs keep it simple. Working with AI, I‚Äôve been able to create the foundation for my new brand. I‚Äôll spare you the details, but here is more or less what I‚Äôm going for (the AI generated image is soooooo funny üòÜ)

Ok, I‚Äôm about to dive in. It‚Äôs 3:23PM, I took a break to have a B O M B chicken jibarito sandwich. üòã

## Diving into the Code

### The Tech

Btw, here‚Äôs what my project stack looks like. This is a screenshot of my `package.json` file, which essentially is used to list all the package dependencies included to run the app. It‚Äôs mostly using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) on top of React.

![Package JSON](/images/blog-4/package-json.png)

Already, I see this will have to change and add our new `@fontsource` lines for the new fonts.

---

## 4:35PM.

Alright, it‚Äôs been a long afternoon, but we made the font changes. I also removed where I defined the font multiple times, so in the future it‚Äôll be a much more centralized process and take less time.

Woohoo for finding efficiencies!

Ok, the last few things I‚Äôd like to quickly get done today for this blog‚Ä¶

1. Create updated logo
2. Change color used in highlight (buttons, links, horizontal line on site header)
3. Upload today‚Äôs blog post
4. Ensure today‚Äôs blog post has a proper title, description, and image in social media preview
5. Make a post on LinkedIn sharing updates.

Let‚Äôs get it!

New logo ideas:

<img src="/images/blog-4/logo-2.png" alt="logo idea 2" class="img-md" />
<img src="/images/blog-4/logo-3.png" alt="logo idea 3" class="img-md" />
<img src="/images/blog-4/logo-4.png" alt="logo idea 4" class="img-md" />

## 5:36PM

Ooh, this would all be great for a ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your personal brand?‚Äù post. This fresh new logo, plus a sick shot of me as a speaker on stage in a suit.

### Yaaaaas.

## 7:12PM

Okay, so, I spent a significant amount of time rebranding my website. You can find most of the work I did in [this pull request](https://github.com/jvmontes/basic-blog/pull/25).

## 10:43PM

### Alright, we've made some fantastic progress today.

I'm currently adding the images to this blog, and feeling pretty good with the progress made today.
I am contemplating testing another set of colors, and I will cross that bridge when I get to it... but at least today, I was able to undergo a complete rebrand on my website, make it more resilient to future changes, and making my code more robust as I revisit it for this endeavor.

## 5/6/25 12:28AM

Alright, been a late night and a long day. But feeling really good with the progress I've made today!

Here's a final rundown of the new pages and what they look like!

### New Website Home Page

## One final note...

I also wanted to quickly share that this project doesn't end here. As part of this creative endeavor, I am going to create in other ways, as well. This might look like blogs on LinkedIn, TikTok videos, YouTube videos, and other mediums. This is the central catalyst for this impact - I'll have this as my homebase behind the scenes as I continue to build. Thanks for being along for the ride.

### If you wanna make sure you don't miss out on any new posts, send me a message to add you to my VIP list (newsletter, but it's 2025 so it's cool).

Thanks for reading!
