Hello, world! It is I, Jorge Viramontes, coming back at ya with a brand new blog entry!

<aside class="callout">
  <div>💡</div> <div><strong>Note:</strong> For this post, I will work to maintain the blog strictly in my own voice, not with the assistance of an AI assistant 🤖. All of the text content, aka the storytelling, is originally written (you can probably tell). AI is only used to achieve styling tasks, resolve issues, and help with the creative process-- not for its generative content creation capabilities. </div>

</aside>

I am at Cafe El Meson sipping on a latte and listening to my [🎻 Classical Music playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1QP9ZaHzM0VxSRiURJMXMW?si=f7102b4c301f4d2e) on shuffle with noise-cancelling headphones.

## Restoring Integrity

I currently am an unemployed-solopreneur-multi-hyphenate. I could go into detail and tell you my story right here and now, but I think the most important part for you to know is that: I am a software engineer and builder, and I’m currently working on dedicating concentrated time on building my personal website, using it as a platform to work on my craft, shape my narrative, and channel my voice.

I’m a pretty fast typer. Through typing, my fingers can mostly keep up with my brain, better than the pen can. So here we are, re-launching this thing, yet again.

But this time, it’s different. I see the larger strategy. I have my priorities in order. I’m in a good headspace to just _produce_, and I’m so grateful for that.

Anywho, I have an ongoing list of things I’d like to do. I’m going to try and dedicate time to get this done as quickly as possible, leveraging a bit of AI if I need it.

My objective is to re-do my blog’s branding— logo, colors, fonts, etc. I have a pretty good idea of how to do this, but now just need to execute.

This is particularly fun for me, because this will be the first time I fully document my workflow, make the changes, and post the artifact somewhere.

## Current State of the Blog

Before implementing these changes, it’s always nice to see where we’re at to acknowledge how far we’ve come in our work.

Here are some screenshots of different components of this fun project.

### Current Website Homepage

### Blog Entry Social Media Link

Below, you can see what a link to my blog looks like on LinkedIn. Unfortunately, it doesn’t include any images or additional description text. It would be nice to add these things to make the preview more visually engaging. I’m going to look into this!

### Blog Entry iMessage Preview

Below, this is what it looks like on iMessage. I would like to enrich this, as well.

### Blog Entry on Web

This is what an entry on the blog currently looks like.

## Future Vision of the Blog

As time has gone on, it’s been hightime for me to refresh my blog. The new aesthetic will be professional, bold, impactful, and trustworthy.

Btw, I wrote this entire post on a Notion page first. It’s fun bc I’m used to using Notion, and it’s a great way for me to write fast, get all the pieces together I want, and then at transfer time, it should be pretty straightforward (except images, which will require some manual effort) to transfer onto a `.md` file for hosting on my domain. Fun stuff!

</aside>

Let’s keep it simple. Working with AI, I’ve been able to create the foundation for my new brand. I’ll spare you the details, but here is more or less what I’m going for (the AI generated image is soooooo funny 😆)

Ok, I’m about to dive in. It’s 3:23PM, I took a break to have a B O M B chicken jibarito sandwich. Lemme know if you wanna know where it was from and wanna try it, I’ll send the rec your way! 😋

## Diving into the Code

### The Tech

Btw, here’s what my project stack looks like. This is a screenshot of my `package.json` file, which essentially is used to list all the package dependencies included to run the app. It’s mostly using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) on top of React.

Already, I see this will have to change and add our new `@fontsource` lines for the new fonts.

4:35PM.

Alright, it’s been a long afternoon, but we made the font changes. I also removed where I defined the font multiple times, so in the future it’ll be a much more centralized process and take less time.

Woohoo for finding efficiencies!

Ok, the last few things I’d like to quickly get done today for this blog…

1. Create updated logo
2. Change color used in highlight (buttons, links, horizontal line on site header)
3. Upload today’s blog post
4. Ensure today’s blog post has a proper title, description, and image in social media preview
5. Make a post on LinkedIn sharing updates.

Let’s get it!

New logo ideas:

Ooh, this would all be great for a “What’s your personal brand?” post. This fresh new logo, plus a sick shot of me as a speaker on stage in a suit. Yaaaaas.

7:12PM

Okay, so, I spent a significant amount of time rebranding my website. You can find most of the work I did in [this pull request](https://github.com/jvmontes/basic-blog/pull/25).
