Here’s my story.

From 2014 to 2021, I worked as a software engineer at a fantastic consulting firm in downtown Chicago. I worked with incredibly smart people, added code to features that were shipped for Fortune 500 companies, and learned a lot about what it means to provide massive value.

On May 14th, 2021, two weeks before my 30th birthday on May 30th (yay, Golden Birthday!!), I took a leap of faith. I quit my full-time consulting job in search of personal fulfillment.

I thought I’d be earning $10k/mo. without doing a single thing. Thanks, [Modern Millionaires!](https://themmsaas.com/)

**PRO-TIP: Read the disclaimers and fine print.**

Clearly, that was not the case. I did not earn the types of figures these people were posting about. I did not fully embrace the automated systems and did not get a list of 100 emails and randomly send them a spammy message. I did not keep paying these absurd monthly fees. I didn’t feel motivated by their prospects of white labeling and getting a digital marketing system working for my clients.

I think the tools this program shared were meticulously thought out. The Modern Millionaires education was based on using this system, paying it, and pushing it out there to create deals that would magically make you money. I thought that was an absolute recipe for disaster. I think they harnessed something powerful and special, and turned it into a giant money-making hope-selling machine.

But, it wasn’t all bad.

Because of that hope, I had the courage and vision to make it a reality.

Quitting my full-time job of more than eight years felt like I was cutting the rope, and I was free-falling financially with gravity weighing me down. I no longer had the safety and security I had so fondly become familiar with, and I need to find something that would help pay the bills.

But also, giving myself the freedom to truly explore my passions, love, family, relationships, rest, discovery, and introspection…

I traveled.

I journaled.

I blogged.

I attended webinars.

I met so many new people.

I held on to faith that things would work out for me. I was hungry. I was curious. I had a million and one ideas on how I wanted to spend my energy. I strived to find that ever-elusive balance between pursuing my passions and doing something practical.

The journey has been honestly wild, unexpected, turbulent, emotional, challenging, and a deeply rewarding experience.

Wanna know more?

And stay tuned.

I’m excited to share with you : )
