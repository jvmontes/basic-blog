## Posting a New Blog Post

I‚Äôd like to quickly walk through my process for uploading a new post. This post will be a bit more technical, but my hope is that it stays accessible.

### By making a new branch of my project, I am able to complete the development changes necessary and upload a single commit to a remote branch.

My GitHub project is setup to spin up a new build on Netlify whenever a new pull request is created. I simply create a new pull request for that new branch, merge the branch, and it‚Äôs deployed to production. I can even see a deploy preview when the PR is created such that I can make sure to check for any funky errors before deploying to production.

## Here is my quick and easy process for uploading a new blog entry:

### 1) Make a New Branch in SourceTree

### 2) Create a New Blog Page in VS Code

### ~~3) Copy Content from Notion into Markdown Page~~

<aside class="callout">
  <div>üí°</div> <div><strong>Note:</strong> I realized that taking screenshots of my screen and storing them on Notion was causing an inefficiency. I would have to download the image and reupload to the project `static/images` folder. A great approach to minimize manual labor is to just create a folder in Finder for my new blog post and just upload them directly. </div>
</aside>

### 4) Add Metadata to Top of File

### 5) Save and Run Project

### 6) Page is Ready

Now, all we have to do is double-check the styling and make sure it looks like we're expecting it to.

### 7) Commit Changes

Finally, I go back to SourceTree, stage changes I'd like to keep, add a commit message, and push to my remote repository.

### 8) Create a Pull Request

On Github, I simply go in and create a new pull request for this branch.

### 9) Test & Deploy Preview Through Netlify

By integrating with Netlify, we generate a deploy preview to view changes.

Once it looks good, we can simply merge the pull request, and Netlify re-deploys a latest build to our custom domain.

#### Netlify Dashboard

In my case, it deploys to [https://www.jorgeviramontes.com/](https://www.jorgeviramontes.com)
