## Posting a New Blog Post

Iâ€™d like to quickly walk through my process for uploading a new post. This post will be a bit more technical, but my hope is that it stays accessible.

### By making a new branch of my project, I am able to complete the development changes necessary and upload a single commit to a remote branch.

My GitHub project is setup to spin up a new build on Netlify whenever a new pull request is created. I simply create a new pull request for that new branch, merge the branch, and itâ€™s deployed to production. I can even see a deploy preview when the PR is created such that I can make sure to check for any funky errors before deploying to production.

### Here is my quick and easy process for uploading a new blog entry:

#### 1) Make a New Branch in SourceTree

#### 2) Create a New Blog Page in VS Code

#### 3)r Copy Content from Notion into Markdown Page

<aside class="callout">
  <div>ðŸ’¡</div> <div><strong>Note:</strong> I realized that taking screenshots of my screen and storing them on Notion was causing an inefficiency. I would have to download the image and reupload to the project `static/images` folder. A great approach to minimize manual labor is to just create a folder in Finder for my new blog post and just upload them directly. </div>
</aside>

#### 4) Add Metadata to Top of File

#### 5) Save and Run Project

## Conclusion

Pretty cool to come and revisit analytics and not need to worry about doing anything different in my uploading process to make sure theyâ€™re being tracked. Iâ€™m looking forward to continue, and to see how different techniques and posting cadences yield different results.
