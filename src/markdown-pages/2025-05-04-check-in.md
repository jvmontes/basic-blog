**Dear Jorge,**

This season of life is about **courage, consistency, and creative power.**

I am choosing to move forward because my voice, my gifts, and my ideas matter.

Every application I send, every note I sing, every piece of content I create â€” they are seeds. Some will bloom faster than others, but all of them are part of the future I am building.

I trust that if I stay consistent, keep challenging myself, and lead with courage, the right opportunities, people, and breakthroughs will come into view.

I am proud of how far I've come. I am excited about where Iâ€™m going.

Letâ€™s go. ðŸŒŸ

**-Jorge**
